ðŸš€ Software engineer since 2011, dedicated to building high-quality, high-traffic web applications and APIs.

ðŸŒ± I've had the opportunity to collaborate with various organizations, from startups to established companies, contributing to an large array of projects. These include e-commerce platforms, ride-sharing apps, supply-chain management systems, IoT platforms and application tracking systems, to name a few. I thrive in small, dynamic teams but also excel independently, managing the full software development life cycleâ€”from requirements gathering to delivery and maintenance.

âœ… My practical experience includes working with technologies such as Go (Golang), Java, Python, PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, RabbitMQ, GCP and Microsoft Azure in production environments.

ðŸ’» I am targeting technical roles at the senior level or above(Staff, Principal, etc). My preference is for remote or hybrid full-time positions. At this time, I am not open to on-site roles or relocation in other country.
