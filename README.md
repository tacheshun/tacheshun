ðŸš€ As an established software engineer and technical lead since 2011, I have dedicated myself to constructing high-quality, high-traffic web applications and APIs.

ðŸŒ± I've had the opportunity to collaborate with various organizations, from startups to established companies, contributing to an array of projects. These include e-commerce platforms, ride-sharing apps, supply-chain management systems, and application tracking systems, to name a few. I thrive in small, dynamic teams but also excel independently, managing the full software development life cycleâ€”from requirements gathering to delivery and maintenance.

âš¡ My professional interests encompass distributed systems, cloud-native architectures, and the Go programming language. If these areas align with your needs, I would be delighted to connect.

âœ… My practical experience includes working with technologies such as Go (Golang), Java, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP and Microsoft Azure in production environments.

ðŸ”­ I am multilingual, with proficiency in English, Spanish, and Romanian, which has aided in my professional communication and collaboration across diverse teams.

ðŸ’» I am targeting technical roles at the senior level or above(Staff, Principal, Architect, etc). My preference is for remote or hybrid full-time positions. At this time, I am not open to on-site roles or relocation in other country.
