🚀 As an established software engineer and technical lead since 2011, I have dedicated myself to constructing high-quality, high-traffic web applications and APIs.

🌱 I've had the opportunity to collaborate with various organizations, from startups to established companies, contributing to an array of projects. These include e-commerce platforms, ride-sharing apps, supply-chain management systems, and application tracking systems, to name a few. I thrive in small, dynamic teams but also excel independently, managing the full software development life cycle—from requirements gathering to delivery and maintenance.

⚡ My professional interests encompass distributed systems, cloud-native architectures, and the Go programming language. If these areas align with your needs, I would be delighted to connect.

✅ My practical experience includes working with technologies such as Go (Golang), Java, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, gRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP and Microsoft Azure in production environments.

🔭 I am multilingual, with proficiency in English, Spanish, and Romanian, which has aided in my professional communication and collaboration across diverse teams.

💻 I am targeting technical roles at the senior level or above(Staff, Principal, Architect, etc). My preference is for remote or hybrid full-time positions. At this time, I am not open to on-site roles or relocation in other country.
