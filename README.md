😄  I'm an experienced software developer building high quality and high traffic web applications and APIs since 2011.

🌱  I've been working both for small and big companies in a wide range of projects: e-commerce websites, tubes websites, marketplaces, internal evaluation software, supply-chain management apps and application tracking systems.
